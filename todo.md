## TODOs

## Chunk 1: Sloth Love Chunk

- make basic word display component
- set up RapidAPI access to WordsAPI
- play with WordsAPI

## Chunk 2: Whoa, That's Chunky

- sketch out data structure--linked list or graph? Latter is the correct choice but would be more complex. I don't know if I want to 'iterate' to it and rewrite all the methods for adding/removing/navigating nodes
- write code for adding to graph based on word clicks
- hold off on most styling for now

## Chunk 3: Choosy Moms Choose JifÂ® Chunky

- add styling (Tailwind?)
